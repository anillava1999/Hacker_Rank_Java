/* Let's say you have an integer array and a string array. You have to write a SINGLE method printArray that can print all the elements of both arrays. The method should be able to accept both integer arrays or string arrays.

You are given code in the editor. You have to complete it so that it prints the following lines:

1
2
3
Hello
World
You should not use method overloading (your answer will not get accepted). */
